### Permissions

User data is not required nor accessed by this extension - I am a user of this extension too, and believe heavily in the protection of users' privacy and personal data.

I am not collecting anything, nor is it possible for me to retrieve anything; below is an explanation of permissions in Hash-tag-selector: YouTube with definitions copied from Chrome's developer page.

activeTab: The activeTab permission gives an extension temporary access to the currently active tab when the user invokes the extension - for example by clicking its browser action. Access to the tab lasts while the user is on that page, and is revoked when the user navigates away or closes the tab.

activeTab is used in order to apply changes to the current tab of website.

localStorage is not been used at the moment.
